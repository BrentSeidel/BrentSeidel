# The Profile of Brent Seidel

I graduated with a BSE concentrating on electrical engineering in 1988 from Walla Walla University.  Since then, I've
mostly worked in the aerospace industry - mostly on commercial and general aviation avionics.  I've done requirements,
testing, software, and hardware.  In 2011, I completed an online Masters of Engineering (MEng) program from Arizona
State University, concentrating on systems engineering

I was a direct employee until 1998 when I was convinced to move to Phoenix and be a contract engineer.  I've done that
ever since.  The nice thing for me is that in the breaks between contracts, I can work on my own personal projects.
Several of these projects are available here on GitHub.

I am currently working on teaching myself VHDL.
